Three release candidates dropped in the first 5 days of 2021! I'll tell you what's up with that. Meanwhile, the Sample project gets a website, [issues](https://github.com/scottoffen/grapevine/issues) are turned on as well as [discussions](https://github.com/scottoffen/grapevine/discussions), [code of conduct](https://github.com/scottoffen/grapevine/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/scottoffen/grapevine/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) are in place, and so I turn my focus now to documentation.

## Release Candidate 5.0.0-rc.0

The first release candidate saw the first implementation of `ContentFolder`, which makes it possible to easily serve static files (e.g. a website) from Grapevine. You will, of course, need to turn on the middleware to make that happen, as the logic for returning files was moved out of the `RestServer` and into `OnRequest` handlers.

```csharp
var folderPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "website");
server.ContentFolders.Add(new ContentFolder(folderPath));
server.UseContentFolders();
```

## Release Candidate 5.0.0-rc.1

Sadly, the first release candidate was short lived. I realized almost immedietly that I forgot to change the default service lifetime of the route classes to `Scoped`, and instead left them at `Transient`. Maybe not a big deal, but depending on how granular your routes are, could be huge. Huge. So, I fixed it.

I also realized as I was beefing up the Sample project that there was a problem with the way path info was being generated in the route scanner when base paths and regular expression strings were being passed in, so I fixed that, too.

## Release Candidate 5.0.0-rc.2

Being able to match routes based on header values has been on the Grapevine 5 roadmap from the start. I've been kicking around how to implement that with the route scanner for awhile now, and I think I have a suitable solution here. This is the only code change in this release candidate.

## Sample Project Website

The Samples project is intended to show useage patterns for easy adoption. I've added a nice website to the sample, and a bunch of example routes that you can look at and experiment with. There is even an example of a route that stops the server, invoked from a button on the webpage!

And with this, I turn my focus to documentation.
