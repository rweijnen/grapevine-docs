The first beta version of Grapevine 5.0 was uploaded to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/) today. If you were hoping for an easy upgrade path from earlier versions to 5.0, I'm afraid you will be in for a dissapointment.

## Thank You For Your Support

On the one hand, this has been a huge undertaking for me. Since version 4 first dropped, I've received literally hundereds of requests for new features, bug fixes, and updates - all on top of the changes I wanted to make. I knew early on that for Grapevine to be what I knew it could be, I'd have to do a complete rewrite.

On the other hand, putting aside all the false starts and spikes I've done over the ensuing years, this new version took me less than a week to get it to where it is today. It's not ready for production yet, and it's still better than anything that came before it. And I anticipate it will take about another week to get a production ready version out.

It is because of the interest shown by the community of users that have found it useful that I have continued to maintain and improve on this library, despite the limitations on my time. Thank you for using it, thank you for providing feedback on it, and thank you for your continued support.

## Things To Know

A new major version naturally brings with it breaking changes. In the case of Grapevine 5, it (as [Jonathan Coulton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LrZ01A6Q_M) might say) breaks everything in the nicest way.

If you have used a previous version of Grapevine, here is a quick summary of some thing you should know going in, in no particular order.

- Target Frameworks: netstandard2.0, netstandard 2.1, and net5.0
- Symbols package is also up on NuGet, for easier debugging during development
- There is no more Grapevine.Client (it is recommend to use [`IHttpClientFactory`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests))
- The single URI restriction has been removed
- Everything you need in the library is now in the Grapevine namespace
- Grapevine is async all the way through the stack
- _This_ beta does not contain an `IContentFolder` (formerly `IPublicFolder`) implementation
- There are built in extension for adding CORS and correlation ids
- Standards based dependency injection (using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`) and logging (using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`)
- Resource classes are no longer required to have parameterless constructor (see above)

## Code Sample

:::warning

The `RestServer.DeveloperConfiguration` extension method is only available in this beta. It will be replaced with similar extension methods for simple start up and configuration.

:::

```csharp {12} title="Program.cs"
using System;
using System.Linq;
using Grapevine;

namespace MyConsoleApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Starting Grapevine Server");
            using (var server = RestServer.DeveloperConfiguration((services) =>
            {
                // If your resources need dependencies injected, register those classes here
            }, true))
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Server will listen on {string.Join(", ", server.Prefixes)}");
                server.Start();

                Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the sample server.");
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Of course, you'll need some routes to go along with that...

```csharp title="MyResource.cs"
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Grapevine;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace MyConsoleApp
{
    [RestResource]
    public class MyResource
    {
        private readonly ILogger<MyResource> _logger;

        public MyResource(ILogger<MyResource> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [RestRoute("Get", "/hello", Name = "Test Route", Description = "Just a route to test stuff with.", Enabled = true)]
        public async Task HelloWorld(IHttpContext context)
        {
            await context.Response.SendResponseAsync("Hello, world!");
        }

        [RestRoute]
        public async Task CathcAll(IHttpContext context)
        {
            _logger.LogTrace($"{context.Request.HttpMethod} {context.Request.PathInfo} : Catch All Method");
            await context.Response.SendResponseAsync(HttpStatusCode.Ok);
        }
    }
}
```
